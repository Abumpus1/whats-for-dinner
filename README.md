# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

This was a mini ungraded school project, used to test how well I could build out a site based on comp, using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

User should be able to select a side, main dish, or desert, click let's cook, and be shown a random meal idea. User can then select another option or click clear and hide the currently shown option. Due to the small size of this project, functionality remained fairly limited.

## Resources

## Learning Goals

- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set
